# Git And Intellij

## Overview
The Git workflow in IntelliJ is super different from VSCode in that
because IntelliJ, as an IDE, offers more built in tools to help with
version control over VSCode

Note that all tracked files seem to be staged by default, while untracked
files are added to a "Untracked Changelist"

## Committing Changes
Committing changes is done via accessing the Version Control toolbar
on the bottom left of the editor.

You can also use `Ctrl + K` to commit current changes.

Once you commit your changes, a new commit window shows up. From there
committing your changes is pretty straight forwards.

## Changelists
Something that IntelliJ lets you do over VSCode is have different
Changelists for various parts of your stuff
